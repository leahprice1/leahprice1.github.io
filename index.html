            Welcome to my project!!
            <br>
            This is a website designed to showcase some HTML/Jquery effects and help exercise GUI fimiliarity
            On the next few tabs I'll go over those effects, tell you a bit about myself, and give you my contact
            information.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            The main requirements for this project were to: 
            <br>
            1. create a personal website with multiple tabs
            <br>
            2. Host the website on Github
            <br>
            3. Maintain good file and folder structure.
            <br>
            As you can see, I do in fact have a personal website with multiple tabs. It is in fact hosted on github, 
            and there is good folder and file organization in my opinion. Obviously, AI helped a lot with this
            project because creating a website from scratch takes too long and I already know how to do that! I used
            AI as well to help me understand more about the Jquery effects and how to implement them into my website.

        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="tabs-2">
        <p>
            This tab displays all of the effects I used for my project! For more information open the accordian effect
            below to learn about each one. 
        </p>
        
        <!-- first effect -->
        <div id="accordion">
            <h3>Accordian</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                This is the currect effect you're on! This effects, and all others after, were
                taken from the jQuery user interface site shown in class. This creates sections
                that when opened, close the other sections above or below it (like an accordian).
                You can put whatever you want within these sections but for the purpose of this 
                website and project, I'm only putting text.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Check Boxes</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                The check boxes are an effect that create multiple boxes with the ability to check
                and uncheck them, different labels can be created and it can be used to show certain 
                selections and basically have any functionality that you can think of for checkboxes.
                For the purpose of this project and website it's just checking compliments that apply
                to me. :)
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Slider</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                The slider effect is pretty self explanatory, it's just a box that slides left and 
                right on a bar. This could also be used for lots of implimentations, basically anything
                you can think to use a slider for, for the purpose of this project it's just a normal
                slider.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Date Picker</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                This is also pretty self explanatory,  this effect has a box and when you click it it
                allows you to pick a date by pulling up a little calendar. You can scroll through the months
                and years and specify which date you need. This doesn't have as wide of a range of 
                functionality as the previous effects but its very useful.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Ellipse Changer</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                This effect was one I modified, it was originally used to change the color and size of a circle,
                but I decided it would be more interesting to change the width and height so that's what I did. 
                Out of all the effects this one probably has the least functionality compared to the others but
                there are still some uses I could think of this being used for, like changing the dimensions of
                an image.
                </p>

            Hello, my name is Leah Price!
            <br>
            I'm a Junior at the University of Indianapolis majoring in Computer Science with a minor in
            Criminal Justice. I currently work at 7brew (A coffee shop) but I'm seeking opportunities in
            Computer Science and Digital Forensics. Criminal Justice really interests me and I love going
            to my Criminal Justice classes. 

            Here are some of my most relevant courses to the opportunities I'm seeking:
            <ul>
                <li>Criminal Evidence</li>
                <li>Operating Systems</li>
                <li>Database Systems</li>
                <li>Intro to Cyber Security</li>
                <li>Intro to Criminal Justice</li>
                <li>Data Structures</li>
                <li>Computer Algorithms</li>
                <li>Ethics of New Technologies</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            I have some previous experience as a teaching assistant at my university of an introduction to
            programming course. Despite the beginner level course material it taught me a lot about portraying
            CS ideas to people who don't understand them. I was also a teaching assistant for a biology and 
            online safety course at my highschool, this also taught be similar skills for younger students.
        </p>

    <div id="tabs-4">
        <p>
            This tab is about some more personal things about me like my hobbies, music taste, friends, family etc.
            <br>
            Hobbies:
            <ul>
                <li>Reading:<br>
                    I really enjoy reading, I have since I was super young. My favorite book of all time is either
                    The Maze Runner or A Little Life. These two books took over my life when I read them so they 
                    mean a lot to me!
                </li>
                <li>Watching Shows: <br>
                    This is another huge hobby of mine, I think it's pretty cliche to say I really enjoy watching 
                    shows/TV but it's true so I decided to include it anyways. My favorite show easily is Supernatural,
                    I have almost every season on dvd but I wouldn't recommend starting it to anyone because it's way
                    too long.
                </li>
                <li>Listening to Music: <br>
                    I loveee listening to music! My favorite genre is rock, and my favorite artist is Guns and Roses. I
                    mainly listen to dad rock for the most part but other than that I also listen to mostly anything
                    that's more popular.
                </li>
                <li>Crocheting: <br>
                    I started crocheting when I was really young, my mom taught me because I was bored one day after
                    school and it kind of just stuck. I'm not the best at finishing projects I start to crochet because
                    it takes forever and I get bored but it's still enjoyable even if I don't finish every piece.
                </li>
                <li>Video Games: <br>
                    This is also another hobby that started when I was very young, I used to watch my brother play COD 
                    zombies when I was little and it just grew from there. A lot of it was watching him play video games 
                    but then it became me asking to play with him and then going out of my way to play alone. My favorite
                    video game is Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild!
                </li>
